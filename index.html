I'm Ashvik, a 16-year-old filmmaker from Hyderabad, India. From
 a young age, I've had a passion for creating stories and bringing 
 them to life through the medium of film. It all began when I was just 
 a child, and I discovered the magical world of movies. However, what 
 truly captivated me was not just watching films, but understanding the 
 intricate process behind their creation.
</p>
<p>As a child, I would often find myself immersed in the world of storytelling. 
    At the young age of 6, I started crafting my own tales, fueled by my vivid 
    imagination and a desire to share my narratives with others. Initially, my 
    primary audience consisted of my parents, who always lent a patient ear to
     my imaginative tales. Occasionally, I would also gather my friends around, 
     eager to captivate them with the stories that unfolded in my mind.</p>

<p>
I immersed into the art of creating films since I was 10 and
 have continued to pursue the hobby for over half a decade, creating almost a dozen short films.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I've also written multiple screenplays, with a few winning awards as well. </p>
